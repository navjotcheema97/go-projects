# Go Concurrency Problems

This repository contains solutions to various concurrency programming problems implemented in Go.

## Project Structure
- `problems/`: Contains all concurrency programming problems
  - Each problem is in its own directory (p001, p002, etc.)
  - Each problem directory contains:
    - `problem.md`: Problem description
    - `solution.go`: Solution implementation
    - `solution_test.go`: Tests for the solution
- `pkg/`: Shared utilities and helper functions

## Problems List
1. [Prime Number with Goroutines](problems/p001_concurrent_prime/problem.md) - Check prime numbers using goroutines
2. (More concurrency problems to be added...)
